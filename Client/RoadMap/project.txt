Project Overview:
Ek online bookstore website banani hai jisme users books browse kar sake, cart mein add kar sake, aur checkout kar sake. Admin ko bhi ek dashboard milega jahan wo books add/edit/delete kar sake.

Features:
Frontend (React.js):

Book listing page with search and filter options (category, price range, author, etc.).

Book details page (description, reviews, price).

User authentication (login/signup with JWT token).

Cart functionality (add/remove books, quantity change).

Checkout page (payment integration using Stripe or Razorpay).

Backend (Node.js + Express):

User authentication (JWT-based).

REST API for managing books, categories, and orders.

Admin routes for adding/editing/deleting books.

Order management (users can view their order history).

Handle payments (integrate payment gateway for checkout).

Database (MongoDB):

Users (name, email, password).

Books (title, author, price, category, description, stock).

Orders (user details, books ordered, total price, status).

Bonus (Optional):

Add reviews and ratings for books.

Email notifications for order confirmation and status updates.

Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js, Redux (optional for state management), CSS/Bootstrap.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT for authentication.

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose for ORM).

Payment: Stripe or Razorpay for payment integration.

Version Control: Git & GitHub.








Step 1: Planning and Designing
1.1. Requirements Gathering:

Determine the features you want to include (e.g., book listing, cart, checkout, admin dashboard).

List out all the pages (Home, Book Details, Cart, Checkout, Admin Dashboard, etc.).

1.2. Database Design:

Users: User information (name, email, password, orders).

Books: Book details (title, author, price, category, description, stock, reviews).

Orders: Order details (user, list of books, total price, order status).

1.3. Wireframing:

Sketch out wireframes of key pages (like Home, Book Details, Cart, Admin Dashboard).

Tools like Figma or Sketch use kar sakte ho wireframe design karne ke liye.

Step 2: Setup Project Structure
2.1. Frontend Setup:

Create a new React project using create-react-app.

Set up folder structure (components, pages, services, utils).

2.2. Backend Setup:

Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init.

Install necessary dependencies (Express, MongoDB, JWT, bcrypt, etc.).

Set up folder structure (models, routes, controllers, middlewares).

2.3. Git & GitHub:

Initialize a Git repository for version control.

Create a GitHub repository to push your code.

Step 3: Backend Development (API Development)
3.1. Setup Express Server:

Setup basic Express server with routes for books, users, and orders.

3.2. User Authentication:

Implement JWT-based authentication (sign up, login, and token verification).

Use bcrypt for password hashing.

3.3. Book Routes & Controllers:

Create API routes for fetching all books, a single book, and adding/editing books (Admin functionality).

Set up book filtering and searching based on categories, price, and author.

3.4. Order Routes:

Create routes to manage orders (add order, view order history).

3.5. Payment Integration:

Integrate Stripe or Razorpay for payment processing at the checkout stage.

3.6. MongoDB Setup:

Use Mongoose to create MongoDB schemas for Users, Books, and Orders.

Connect MongoDB to your Express app using Mongoose.

Step 4: Frontend Development (React)
4.1. Layout and Basic UI:

Start with the homepage where books are listed.

Add navigation (Home, Cart, Login/Signup, Admin Dashboard).

4.2. Book Listing Page:

Fetch book data from the backend and display books dynamically.

Add a search and filter option for books.

4.3. Book Details Page:

Display detailed information for each book (description, reviews, add to cart).

4.4. Cart Functionality:

Implement cart where users can add/remove books and adjust quantity.

4.5. Checkout Page:

Create the checkout page where users enter shipping info and make a payment.

Integrate payment API (Stripe or Razorpay).

4.6. User Authentication:

Create login/signup pages.

Manage user state using JWT and store the token in localStorage.

4.7. Admin Dashboard:

Create a simple admin dashboard for adding, editing, and deleting books.

Only allow admins to access this page (admin authentication).

4.8. UI Styling:

Use CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling.

Step 5: Testing
5.1. Unit Testing:

Write tests for API routes (using Jest or Mocha).

Test for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).

5.2. UI Testing:

Test React components using Jest and React Testing Library.

Step 6: Deployment
6.1. Frontend Deployment:

Deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.

Set up environment variables (API URLs) for production.

6.2. Backend Deployment:

Deploy the backend on Heroku or DigitalOcean.

Use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database or host MongoDB on your own server.

6.3. Payment Testing:

Test Stripe or Razorpay payment in the live environment.

Step 7: Final Enhancements
7.1. Responsiveness:

Ensure the site is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile.

7.2. Add Reviews and Ratings:

Add functionality where users can review books and give ratings.

7.3. Email Notifications:

Integrate an email service (like SendGrid) for order confirmation and shipping updates.

Step 8: Documentation & Portfolio
8.1. Documentation:

Write clear README documentation for your project (installation, usage, API endpoints, etc.).

8.2. Portfolio:

Add the project to your personal portfolio website.

Step 9: Showcasing Your Project
9.1. GitHub:

Push your final code to GitHub and make it public.

9.2. Demo:

Create a live demo of your project and share it with potential employers or clients.
